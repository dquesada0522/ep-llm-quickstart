## Step 3: Convert the PyTorch Model to GGUF Format

With the environment set up, proceed to convert the Phi-3 Small model from PyTorch to GGUF format using the provided script.

1. **Locate the Conversion Script:**

   The `llama.cpp` repository provides the `convert_hf_to_gguf.py` script for conversion.

2. **Run the Conversion Script:**

   ```powershell
   python convert_hf_to_gguf.py C:\models\Phi-3-small-8k-instruct C:\models\Phi-3-small-8k-instruct.gguf
   ```

   - **Parameters:**
     - `C:\models\Phi-3-small-8k-instruct`: Path to the cloned Phi-3 Small model directory.
     - `C:\models\Phi-3-small-8k-instruct.gguf`: Desired path and filename for the converted GGUF model.

   *Ensure that the paths match your system's directories.*

3. **Monitor the Conversion Process:**

   The script will display progress logs. Wait until the process completes successfully. Upon completion, a `Phi-3-small-8k-instruct.gguf` file will be created in the specified output directory.

---

## Step 4: Create a Modelfile

The `Modelfile` instructs Ollama where to find the GGUF model.

1. **Navigate to the Desired Directory:**

   ```powershell
   cd C:\models
   ```

2. **Create a `Modelfile`:**

   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType File -Name Modelfile
   ```

3. **Edit the `Modelfile`:**

   Open the `Modelfile` in a text editor (e.g., Notepad) and add the following content:

   ```
   FROM C:\models\Phi-3-small-8k-instruct.gguf
   ```

   *Ensure the path matches the location of your converted GGUF model.*

4. **Save and Close the File.**

---

## Step 5: Load the Model into Ollama

Use the `ollama create` command to load the converted model into Ollama.

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator (if not already open).**

2. **Run the `ollama create` Command:**

   ```powershell
   ollama create phi-3-small -f C:\models\Modelfile
   ```

   - **Parameters:**
     - `phi-3-small`: The name you assign to your model. You can choose any name.
     - `-f C:\models\Modelfile`: Path to the `Modelfile` created earlier.

3. **Verify Model Creation:**

   After running the command, you should see a confirmation message indicating that the model has been successfully created.

---

## Step 6: Run the Model

After loading, you can run the model to perform inference tasks.

1. **Run the Model Using Ollama:**

   ```powershell
   ollama run phi-3-small
   ```

   - **Parameters:**
     - `phi-3-small`: The name of your model as specified during creation.

2. **Interact with the Model:**

   Upon running the command, you can start interacting with the model. For example:

   ```
   > Hello, how are you?
   ```

   The model should generate a response based on the input prompt.

---

## Step 7: Verify the Converted Model

Ensure that the GGUF model is correctly formatted and compatible with Ollama by performing a test inference.

1. **Test Inference Using Python:**

   Create a Python script (e.g., `test_inference.py`) with the following content:

   ```python
   import requests
   import json

   # Define the API endpoint
   API_URL = "http://localhost:11434/v1/models/phi-3-small/infer"

   # Define the headers
   headers = {
       "Content-Type": "application/json",
       "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"  # Replace with your actual token if required
   }

   # Define the payload
   payload = {
       "prompt": "Hello, how are you?",
       "max_tokens": 50,
       "temperature": 0.7
   }

   try:
       response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
       response.raise_for_status()
       result = response.json()
       print("Inference Result:", result.get("text"))
   except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
       print(f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}")
   except Exception as err:
       print(f"An error occurred: {err}")
   ```

   - **Note:** Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with your actual API token if Ollama requires authentication.

2. **Run the Python Script:**

   ```powershell
   python C:\path\to\test_inference.py
   ```

   - **Replace `C:\path\to\test_inference.py`** with the actual path to your Python script.

3. **Review the Output:**

   The script should output the inference result generated by the Phi-3 Small model, indicating a successful conversion and integration with Ollama.
